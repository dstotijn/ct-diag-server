    **ct-diag-server** is an HTTP server written in Go for storing and retrieving
    Diagnosis Keys, as defined in Apple/Google's [draft specification](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/)
    of its Contact Tracing Framework. It aims to respect the privacy of its users
    and store only the bare minimum of data needed for anonymous contact tracing.

    In anticipation of the general release of Apple and Google's native APIs (planned
    for May 2020), this application provides a bare bones implementation for the
    framework's server component: a central repository for submitting Diagnosis Keys
    after a positive test, and retrieving a collection of all previously submitted
    Diagnosis Keys.

        To be used for fetching a list of Diagnosis Keys. A typical client is either a mobile device, or an intermediate platform/server of an app developer, for manual/custom distribution of the payload to clients. In either case, the keyset can be regarded as public; it doesn't contain PII.

        The endpoint supports byte range requests as defined in [RFC 7233](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233).
        The `HEAD` method may be used to obtain `Last-Modified` and `Content-Length` headers
        for cache control purposes.

        A `200 OK` response should be expected for normal requests (non-empty and empty),
        and `206 Partial Content` for responses to byte range requests.
        In case of an empty reply, a `Content-Length: 0` header is written.

        A `500 Internal Server Error` response indicates server failure, and warrants a retry

        The HTTP request body should be a bytestream of `1 <= n` Diagnosis Keys, where
        `n` is the max upload batch size configured on the server (default: 14).
        A diagnosis key consists of three parts: the `TemporaryExposureKey` itself (16 bytes), the `RollingStartNumber` (4 bytes, big endian) and the `TransmissionRiskLevel` (1 byte).
        Because the amount of bytes per Diagnosis Key is fixed, there is no delimiter

        To be used for uploading a set of Diagnosis Keys by a mobile client device.
        **Note:** It's still undecided if this server should authenticate requests. Given the
        wide range of per-country use cases and processes, this is now delegated to the server
        operator to shield this endpoint against unauthorized access, and provide its own
        upstream proxy, e.g. tailored to handle auth-z for health personnel.


        The HTTP request body should be a bytestream of `1 <= n` Diagnosis Keys, where
        `n` is the max upload batch size configured on the server (default: 14).
        A diagnosis key consists of two parts: the `TemporaryExposureKey` itself (16 bytes),
        and 2 bytes (big endian) to denote the `ENIntervalNumber` (see above). Because
        the amount of bytes per diagnosis key is fixed, there is no delimiter.

        A `200 OK` response with body `OK` should be expected on successful storage of the
        keyset in the database.
        A `400 Bad Request` response is used for client errors. A `500 Internal Server Error`
        response is used for server errors, and warrants a retry. Error reasons are written
        in a `text/plain; charset=utf-8` response body.

        Duplicate keys are silently ignored.
